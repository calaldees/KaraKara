                Suggesting tracks to be added to karakara.uk (Making a
                suggestion is no guarantee of a track being added - some
                companies have very grumpy lawyers, etc.)

            <p>
                Having good-quality files in the right formats is hugely helpful
                but not required, it'll just take longer for one of us to find a
                video and make the subs ourselves
            </p>

            <p>
                Also note that specific events might choose to restrict which
                tracks are available, eg even if you submit a modern track and
                it gets added to the database, it might not be available at a
                retro-themed event
            </p>
