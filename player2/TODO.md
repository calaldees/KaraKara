- Lyrics embedded in the queue.json would be wonderful, so
  that we don't need to go and fetch and parse the .srt for
  ourselves for every song for every queue update...
- Enter room password in GUI instead of via cookie?
- Join instructions ("Go to karakara, room name is blah") on the projector
  while each song is playing? (How do we avoid being distracting?)
