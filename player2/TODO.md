figre out why "start" button on podium doesn't work (missing auth cookie? Is that why MarkTrackPlayed / MarkTrackSkipped also get ignored by the server?)

save some state
- `root`
- `queue_id`
- `is_podium`

new features
- enter room password in GUI instead of via cookie?
- join instructions on projector
