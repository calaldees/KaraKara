- test priority token view screen with real tokens
- identify own tracks properly (by session instead of by name?)
  - Associate device UUID with queue item?

```
karakara.system.user.readonly
karakara.template.menu.disable
karakara.search.list.threshold
karakara.search.template.button.list_tracks.threshold
karakara.search.list.alphabetical.tags (redundant?)
karakara.search.list.alphabetical.threshold
```

Potential new features:
- broadcast message
- notify user via app when their song is up now / next
- if API says "this event is over", notify "this event has finished" + set `queue_id` to null
- prompt to install PWA
